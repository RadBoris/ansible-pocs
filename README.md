# Ansible "Proof of Concept"

An ansible project that solves and documents some of the issues I've faced while using ansible, vagrant, and remote servers together.

Keeping these examples in a simple, isolated project lets me refer to known working examples, in case I ever have issues while working in more complex projects.

## Inventory

See hosts/README.md for notes specific to inventory files.
